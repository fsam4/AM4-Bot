The required parameters are `<icao|iata>, <icao|iata>` which are the ICAO or IATA codes of the departure and arrival airports. The three optional parameters are `(plane)` which can be used to define the plane to use on this route, `(reputation)` which can be used to define the reputation used in the calculations and `(flights)` which can be used to define the flights per day of the route.

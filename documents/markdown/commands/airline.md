commandName: airline
---
With this command you can search or compare airlines. When searcing for an airline there is only one required argument which is `<name|id>`. This mean you need to either type the name or the ID of that airline. If you cannot find the right airline by username then try ID as that gives more accurate results. When comparing airlines you need to type 2-5 airlines seperated by commas. For example, if you want to compare Prestige Wings and AMBE Airlines type `prestige wings, ambe airlines` when the command prompts for input.

**AM4 Bot is now offline and the bot application will be deleted within an hour or two**. Thank you for using AM4 Discord & Telegram bot! The main aim of this project back when it was launched, was to provide a public AM4 Discord & Telegram bot for anyone to use and invite. I know that bringing this bot to an end will leave a void for some time in public AM4 Discord bots. Therefore, I have decided to open source the bot's source code to possibly help any upcoming bot or tool developers in creating their very own tools. **The bot's source code can be found at https://github.com/fsam4/AM4-Bot**. If you like AM4 Bot, leaving out a star for my repository is appreciated!

__I have also created a discussions page for the repository__, which can be used to share your thoughts, messages or feedback about the source code or AM4 Bot in general, or to ask questions about the source code or tool developing in general. I will occasionally answer these discussions, if there are any. **The discussions page can be found at https://github.com/fsam4/AM4-Bot/discussions**.

Thank you for these two years and all the support & for the final time - goodbye!

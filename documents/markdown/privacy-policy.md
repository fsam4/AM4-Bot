**Telegram**
AM4 Bot only collects the user ID of your Telegram account to connect your data to your account. The collected data includes command inputs for /airline, /alliance, /achievement, /member and /plane. These are used to construct the suggestion keyboards when you use the previously mentioned commands. In addition, AM4 Bot collects your command usage activity. This information is used to create overall statistics and in some cases to detect possible malicious behaviour.

**Airline Manager 4**
AM4 Bot uses the available AM4 API to get any airline, alliance or route information. Additonally plane, airport, achievement and route data can be obtained from the bot's database and AM4 Tools API. AM4 Bot also keeps a record of top 50 alliances (and alliances that use AM4 Bot or request to be recorded) and their growth and members. This data is collected daily via the available AM4 API and is stored to draw graphs to visualize alliance growth, contribution history and other statistics. The bot automatically cleans useless and expired data after a certain period of time.
